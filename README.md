------------------------------

This site is a snapshot of time, made with simple HTML and CSS. 
It is text driven, bookended by poems from Adrienne Rich and Robert Frost. 

I'd consider it an exercise in the vein of relational aestheics. 
Translation: through using elementary tools of web design, I'm creating an online experience that feels much slower than most modern websites. It feels reflective of the strange moment we are in. I wanted it to feel intimate and deliberate.  

------------------------------

It should simply run on any modern browser. 
It was written in VS Code, pushed to Git and published on Glitch. 

------------------------------

The HTML and CSS were fun to write. I had some issues properly configuring VS Code, Github and Glitch. Specifically, I got snagged in generating my SSH code and implementing it. 
Once I got that sorted, I had a problem with pushing a commit to Github. I had a file added that was too large, I didn't realize until it got stuck in my repository. Even though I deleted the file, it was stuck in my git. 
I was able to get some help deleting that git. Then I reinstalled all and had no issues with commiting and pushing. Problem solving actually helped me become more comfortable with writing in terminal. 

*update*
I am still having issues with pushing commits thru terminal. I got an error message that says it failed to push some refs to my repository. Will need some additional troubleshooting.
