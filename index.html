    <h2>What kinds of times are these?</h2>
    <p>There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill<br>and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows<br>near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted<br>who disappeared into those shadows.</p>
    <p>I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled <br>this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, <br>our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, <br>its own ways of making people disappear.</p>
    <p>I won’t tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods<br>meeting the unmarked strip of light—<br>ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: <br>I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.</p>
    <p>And I won’t tell you where it is, so why do I tell you<br>anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these<br>to have you listen at all, it’s necessary<br>to talk about trees.</p>

        <p>Modern life is designed to assualt you with unfulfiled desire, you view everything including yourself through a screen.</p>
        <p>The poverty presses downward on you, under the thumbs of millionaires, billionaires, vast corporations, corrupt goverments, information highways spewing propoganda. We think we like it.</p>
        <p>Try reading a poem.</p>
        <p>Try to say who you are. But don't make it your job, that is opressive and nullifies the power of your voice by making it novel.</p> 
        <p>Try to remember what love is, even though it's hard to do.</p>

        <h2>Nothing Gold Can Stay</h2>
        <p>Nature’s first green is gold, <br>Her hardest hue to hold.<br>Her early leaf’s a flower;<br>But only so an hour.<br>Then leaf subsides to leaf.<br>So Eden sank to grief,<br>So dawn goes down to day.<br>Nothing gold can stay.</p>
