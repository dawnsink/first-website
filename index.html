    <h3>What kinds of times are these?</h3>
    <p>There's a place between two stands of trees where the grass grows uphill<br>and the old revolutionary road breaks off into shadows<br>near a meeting-house abandoned by the persecuted<br>who disappeared into those shadows.</p>
    <p>I've walked there picking mushrooms at the edge of dread, but don't be fooled <br>this isn't a Russian poem, this is not somewhere else but here, <br>our country moving closer to its own truth and dread, <br>its own ways of making people disappear.</p>
    <p>I won’t tell you where the place is, the dark mesh of the woods<br>meeting the unmarked strip of light—<br>ghost-ridden crossroads, leafmold paradise: <br>I know already who wants to buy it, sell it, make it disappear.</p>
    <p>And I won’t tell you where it is, so why do I tell you<br>anything? Because you still listen, because in times like these<br>to have you listen at all, it’s necessary<br>to talk about trees.</p>

        <p>Modern life is designed to assualt you with unfulfiled desire, you view everything including yourself through a screen.</p>
        <p>The poverty presses downward on you, under the thumbs of millionaires, billionaires, vast corporations, corruption, misinformation. We think we like it.</p>
        <p>Try reading a poem.</p>
        <p>Try to say who you are. But don't make it your job, that is opressive and nullifies the power of your voice by making it novel.</p> 
        <p>Try to remember what love is, even though it's hard to do.</p>

        <h3>For the Dead</h3>
        <p>I dreamed I called you on the telephone<br>to say: Be kinder to yourself<br>but you were sick and would not answer</p> 
        <p>The waste of my love goes on this way<br>trying to save you from yourself</p> 
        <p>I have always wondered about the left-over<br>energy, the way water goes rushing down a hill<br>long after the rains have stopped</p>
        <p>or the fire you want to go to bed from <br>but cannot leave, burning-down but not burnt-down<br>the red coals more extreme, more curious<br>in their flashing and dying<br>than you wish they were<br>sitting long after midnight</p>
